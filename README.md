Linear regression is a fundamental statistical method that models the relationship between a dependent variable (what you want to predict) and one or more independent variables (what you use to make the prediction). Think of it as drawing a best-fit straight line through a scatterplot of your data.


Linear regression forms the foundation for more advanced machine learning algorithms.

Technologies used:
