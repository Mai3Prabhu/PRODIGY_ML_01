# US Housing Price Prediction
This project uses a Linear Regression model to predict house prices in the US. The model is built and evaluated using Python's data science libraries.

## Project Overview
The primary goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict the price of a house based on several key features, such as income, number of rooms, and population. The entire process, from data exploration to model evaluation, is handled in a Python environment, likely within a Jupyter Notebook.

## Key Features
- Data Loading and Exploration: The project begins by loading a CSV file and performing an initial analysis to understand the data's structure, identify data types, and check for missing values.

- Data Visualization: Seaborn and Matplotlib are used to visualize relationships between different features, helping to identify correlations that could be useful for the model.

- Linear Regression Model: A linear regression model is built using scikit-learn to establish a relationship between the independent variables (features) and the dependent variable (price).

- Model Evaluation: The model's performance is evaluated by comparing predicted prices with actual prices, using scatter plots and residual histograms to assess its accuracy.

## Technical Stack
- Python: The core programming language used.

- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

- NumPy: For numerical operations.

- Matplotlib: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.

- Seaborn: A data visualization library based on matplotlib that provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.

- Scikit-learn: A robust machine learning library used for building and evaluating the linear regression model.
